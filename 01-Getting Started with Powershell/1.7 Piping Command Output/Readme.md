# 1.7 Piping Command Output

Output of one command becomes input for the next
Referred to as a command pipeline

Examples
command-1 | command-2 | command-3
Get-Service | Sort-Object -property status | Format-List

Creates a new variable called $_
$_ represents the results of the previous command

Can be used to run one command multiple times

Needed when command-1 generates multiple results but command-2 only accepts one result at a time

For example, Get-Process outputs multiple results and you want to pull details about each
Get-Process | Write-Host $_.name

Fails when executed because Write-Host expects one value
Get-Process | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.name }
Executes successfully
