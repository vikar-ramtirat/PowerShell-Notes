# 1.13 Local vs Remote Management
Local Management
    Normally, PowerShell commands are executed against the local host.
    Some commands support a remote target, but not all
    Local commands provide the most reliable environment and the easiest troubleshooting/debugging

Remote Management
    Option 1: Proxying commands to a remote host
        Import-PSSession can allow you to use the installed PowerShell modules on a remote server without installing them locally.
        Proxies any commands that are missing on localhost over to the remote host
        Fairly unreliable
        Errors can be difficult to troubleshoot
        Security context can be difficult to keep track of

    Option 2: Use a remote shell on the desired host
        The best option
        Commands are not proxied, instead you are executing them on the remote host itself
        To configure a target (the remote system):
            Enable WinRM service
            Allow WinRM in Windows Firewall
            Enable-PSRemoting –force
        On your local system:
            Enter-PSSession Server01
            Exit-PSSession

   Option 3: Remote execute a command on multiple systems
        Very useful for automation
        A command is executed simultaneously on several remote systems
        Uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet
        Example:
            Invoke-Command -computername server01, server02, server03 -credential domain\user -scriptblock {get-process}
