# 2.1 Add/Remove Roles and Features

    Role and Feature management is provided by the Server Manager PowerShell module
    The module is installed by default, but not loaded
    NOTE: The PowerShell cmdlets refer to Roles, Features and Role Services as "Features"
    To add a Role/Feature:
        1.Launch PowerShell as an Administrator
        2.Load the Server Manager module
            Import-Module Servermanager

        3.Query the current status of the role/feature
            Get-WindowsFeature
            Get-WindowsFeature -Name <name>
            Get-WindowsFeature | Where-Object { $_.InstallState -EQ "Installed"}
            Get-WindowsFeature | Where Installed
            Get-WindowsFeature | Where InstallState -NE Installed

        4.Install the role/feature
            Add-WindowsFeature <name>
            Add-WindowsFeature Telnet-Client
            Add-WindowsFeature Hyper-V,DNS,DHCP -restart

        5.Verify installation status
            Get-WindowsFeature -Name <name>
